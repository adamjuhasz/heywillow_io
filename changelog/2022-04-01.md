# Changelog 001

Our first changelog! This week we focused on the [unified view](https://heywillow.io/#unified-view) portion of the Willow platform.

## See customer events and trait changes in the lifetime view

You can now see events and trait changes in a customer's lifetime view.

Some cool usage

- Diagnose what steps a customer took arrive at the error. (not everyone writes great bug reports)
- Proactive reach out when a customer hits an http error

[Demo here](https://heywillow.io/demo/stealth/thread/2#node-0/29)

## Segment destination in beta

We're happy to move from alpha in beta with our Segment integration and realizing another piece our vision for a united view of customers' journeys. If you're already using Segment to track events, customer traits, page views, or screen views Willow can ingest these and help you solve customer issues even faster.

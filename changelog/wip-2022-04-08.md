# Changelog 002

Dev week! This week we focused on [Willow's api](https://heywillow.io/docs) to give developers a way to directly interact with Willow.

## API Preview live

You can now see events and trait changes in a customer's lifetime view.

Some cool usage

- Diagnose what steps a customer took arrive at the error. (not everyone writes great bug reports)
- Proactive reach out when a customer hits an http error

## Developer docs

We're happy to move from alpha in beta with our Segment integration and realizing another piece of our vision for a united view of customers' journeys. If you're already using Segment to track events, customer traits, page views, or screen views Willow can now ingest these and help you solve customer issues even faster.

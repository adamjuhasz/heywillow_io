# Changelog 002

API week! This week we focused on [Willow's API](https://heywillow.io/docs) to give developers a way to directly interact with Willow and push events and traits to customers' lifetime views.

## ðŸš€ API live

We released the following ingestion-focused APIs this week

### User

- User trait change [POST /api/v1/user/{user_id}](https://heywillow.io/docs/v1/user/user_id)
- User event tracking [POST /api/v1/user/{user_id}/event](https://heywillow.io/docs/v1/user/user_id/event)
- User delete [DELETE /api/v1/user/{user_id}](https://heywillow.io/docs/v1/user/user_id/delete)

### Group

- Group trait change [POST /api/v1/group/{group_id}](https://heywillow.io/docs/v1/group/group_id)
- Associate a user with a group [POST /api/v1/group/{group_id}/associate](https://heywillow.io/docs/v1/group/group_id/associate)

## ðŸ“š Developer docs

We're really proud of the [developer API reference](http://heywillow.io/docs/v1/introduction) we've put together. Each page not only has the reference bits you need to build with the API but both an interactive request body builder and a live GUI demonstration of how it'll look inside Willow. All the work we do to re-use 99% of code between the demo and platform made this component re-use possible. Higher-order components for the win today.

We're still working on developer guides, best practices, and an interactive playground. Once we're happy with the design, developer experience, and [code quality](https://thenextweb.com/news/steve-jobs-obsession-with-the-quality-of-the-things-unseen#:~:text=He%20said%20that%20his,all%20the%20way%20through.%E2%80%9D) it'll go out ASAP. We would rather get it right then get it out. Frustration-free DX.

## ðŸš€ Platform status monitoring

To keep us accountable to you we've started publicly [monitoring the Willow platform](https://status.heywillow.io). At the moment we have checks on the front-end and back-end of the platform. We'll slowly add more checks as we iterate on how best to verify end-to-end stability.

We've decided that all incidents should be automatic, no more checking twitter if someone forgot to update the status dashboard. When end-to-end tests fail an incident will automatically begin and will only resolve when tests pass again.

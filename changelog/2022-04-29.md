## üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Group unified view enhancements (Filter edition)

Based on feedback to unified view alpha we've worked on iterating it based on your feedback.

## Better filters to cut through the noise and find the signal

- Added filtering by users in the group
- Added filtering based on events / trait changes
- Added filtering on top events so you can better see needles in the event list haystack

## üßπ Frontend infrastructure improvements (WIP)

We're working on switching from React 17 to React 18 to improve site performance. This includes switching lots of our pages to use server components[^server] so we can minimize the javascript we send down the pipe and decrease page loading time. We're also working on transitioning our network code to use the [suspense api](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactsuspense) to allow more [lazy loading of components](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy) increase our page response time.

[^server]: [Shopify has a great intro to React server components](https://shopify.dev/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/framework/react-server-components)

## Debuting Vertex, our component library

We've started cleaning up and open sourcing our component library. It takes [Vercel's design patterns](https://vercel.com/design) and implements it with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). We've attempted to follow Tailwind's utility-first design ethos to make the components easy to modify and use without having to manually add tweaks to the components themselves.

First components to be released:

- [Button](https://heywillow.io/design/button)
- [Fieldset](https://heywillow.io/design/fieldset)

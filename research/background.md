I've tested this helpdesk and was really pleased with it and it was in my top-3 list. We ended up with Zendesk but that was only because of the ability to create and write custom apps inside Zendesk, like displaying additional information about the user as a panel next to the ticket. If we will decide to go from Zendesk to another helpdesk platform, will consider JitBit again because they are not limiting file size for email attachments like Zendesk is doing.

One of my favorite features of Help Scout is that if someone in customer service forwards and email to me it just goes right into my Gmail inbox. Then when I hit reply, it goes through HelpScout and right back to the person. That allows me to use all the cool email apps that we talk about here on Product Hunt, but the full customer conversation is available for the rest of my team in help scout.

Right now I'm exploring some options for host my business help desk. I found LabiDesk and currently running on free trial. It looks like a promising platform. It combines all I need to provide support to my clients and more. The feature I like the most is the shared email inbox, as my team is small, but we all are working at home and sometimes following up with a client gets complicated using traditional email workflow. I will keep testing this tool, but so far, I like it.

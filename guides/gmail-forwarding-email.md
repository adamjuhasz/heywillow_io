1. Create an email address on your Google Apps account that you want your customers to send mail to. Once you’ve created this address and verified that it can receive email, you can configure forwarding.
2. Log into your new Google Apps email account, and then click the gear icon at the top right of any Gmail page, then click "See all settings".
3. Click the "Forwarding and POP/IMAP" tab.
4. Click "Add a forwarding address"
5. Enter **[team namespace]@inbound.heywillow.io** as the email. For security, Google will send a verification to that email address.
6. Click "Proceed"
7. Log into [Willow](https://heywillow.io), open your team's workspace, and select the new thread.
8. Click the verification link in the thread.
9. Back in your Gmail account, select the “Forward a copy of incoming mail to…” option and select your forwarding address from the drop-down menu.
10. Select the action you’d like your messages to take from the drop-down menu. You can choose to keep Gmail’s copy of the message in your inbox, or you can send it automatically to All Mail or Trash. You might want to keep a copy of inbound email in Gmail.
11. Click Save Changes.

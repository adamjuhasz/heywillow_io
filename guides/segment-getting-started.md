With Segment and Willow you can automatically enrich your customerâ€™s lifetime view with actions, events, and customer traits. No more flipping back and forth between tabs to get a complete picture. Solve customer issues faster when you have more context.

## Getting Started

1. From the Destinations catalog page in the Segment App, click **Add Destination**.
2. Search for "Willow" in the Destinations Catalog, and select the "Willow" destination.
3. Choose which Source should send data to the "Willow" destination.
4. Select the correct team from your [Willow workspace](https://heywillow.io/a/workspace){:target="\_blank"}.
5. Go to your team's settings page, select "API Keys", then find and copy the "API key".
6. Enter the "API Key" in the "Willow" destination settings in Segment.

## Supported methods

Willow supports the following methods, as specified in the [Segment Spec](/docs/connections/spec).

### Page

Send [Page](/docs/connections/spec/page) calls to Willow to see what pages a customer has visited to get more context around their issues. For example:

```js
analytics.page();
```

Segment sends Page calls to Willow as a `Viewed Screen`.

### Screen

Send [Screen](/docs/connections/spec/screen) calls to Willow to see what screens a customer has navigated to. For example:

```obj-c
[[SEGAnalytics sharedAnalytics] screen:@"Home"];
```

Segment sends Screen calls to Willow as a `Viewed Page`.

### Identify

Send [Identify](/docs/connections/spec/identify) calls to Willow to add traits to the customer. These are viewable in the lifetime view and customer overview. For example:

```js
analytics.identify("userId123", {
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
});
```

Segment sends Identify calls to Willow as an `identify` event.

### Track

Send [Track](/docs/connections/spec/track) calls to Willow to record an event in a customer's lifetime view. For example:

```js
analytics.track("Login Button Clicked");
```

Segment sends Track calls to Willow as a `track` event.
